### Summary for each algorithm
#### a. K-Means: K-Means groups data into 'k' clusters based on the average position of points. It's good for round-shaped clusters but can be sensitive to where you start.
#### b. DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): DBSCAN finds clusters by looking at how densely packed points are. It's great for various cluster shapes and sizes and doesn't need you to say how many clusters you want.
#### c. Hierarchical Clustering: Hierarchical clustering organizes data into a tree of clusters. It's flexible for different cluster shapes and can show relationships between clusters in a tree diagram.
#### d. BIRCH (Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies): BIRCH is good for large datasets. It builds a tree of clusters gradually and works well with different types of clusters and high-dimensional data.
